**[EN]**

I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Spanish and Portuguese](https://www.colorado.edu/spanish/) at the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). I write about digital literature and media, cultural hybridity, reading practices and books, digital humanities, and multilingualism in academia. My work on these topics has been published in venues like *ASAP Journal*, *PMLA*, *Hispanic Review,* *Debates in the Digital Humanities*, *EBR* and others. I am also a botmaker. My Twitter [bots dedicated to the work of Mexican writer and artist Ulises Carrión](http://antologia.litelat.net/obra-10) were included in the Antología LitELat Vol 1 and have been revived on Bluesky as [@BotCarrión](https://bsky.app/profile/botcarrion.bsky.social/post/3lfpvdw3opm2l). 

Recently, I co-edited the special issue of the Journal of Electronic Publishing on [Multilingual Publishing and Scholarship](https://journals.publishing.umich.edu/jep/). My book [*Binding Media. Hybrid Print-Digital Literatures from across the Americas*](https://www.sup.org/books/binding-media) was published by Stanford University Press in March 2025. 

In the past, I was a co-editor for [the DH2018 special issue of DSH](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/issue/36/Supplement_1) and of the [Hispania Special Issue on Digital Humanities](https://www.aatsp.org/m/event_details.asp?id=1312622). I was part of the executive committee of the [TC Digital Humanities at MLA](https://mla.hcommons.org/groups/digital-humanities/) and the [Committee on Information Technology also at MLA](https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology).
